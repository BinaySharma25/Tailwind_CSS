Iâ€™ve built a small project using Tailwind CSS to explore how powerful and efficient utility-first styling can be. 
Through this project, I learned how to design responsive layouts, customize themes, and structure clean, reusable components â€” all with minimal CSS code.

This project really helped me understand how Tailwind speeds up the development process while keeping the UI consistent and modern. ðŸš€
